For my code logic, I mainly used ChatGPT to debug and sketch out features, or debug.

It usually gives me a foundation that I can build up on.

I would give it existing code:

eg. I would dump all my .java files
Board.java
Country.java
JavaFXManager.java
Main.java
NumberGame.java
NumberGameAbstractClass.java
NumberGameInterface.java
Score.java
ScoreHandler.java
WordGame.java
World.java

And give them one function that I created eg. the play() function from MinecraftRogueLike.class

-----------------------------------------------------------
---------------------- Sketching out features -------------
-----------------------------------------------------------

I would then prompt:

"ok memorize these too.

now start making new functions for me

whenever the game detects there is a card of class "EventCard" you get another option in the menu called "Play event card" but when you play the event card, it looks through its List<String> to see if the required card is also in the users hand. since the other cards are also objects, you might need to use Card.getName()

if the required cards exist in the user's hand, it should say "Successfully played: cardName"

otherwise it would say "Missing requiredcards: " and uses a for loop to show all the required cards that are missing

let me know which files i should update to implement these features"

- most of the time this code doesn't work that well. I just end up referring to it all the time and create my own.

other drafting example:

1) i dump them all the required code

"i have a List<Card> deck

can you stream it in java so that it prints all the Cards that match the EventCard.class() type parameter

and only chuck EventCards in the output"

it then spits out something I could work with. I end up typing and fixing it anyways. but it saves me a lot of time having to type it myself.

-----------------------------------------------------------
---------------------- Debugging --------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------

i literally just dump all my code that im too tired to debug and only say the 2 simple lines below

"pls fix".

-----------------------------------------------------------
---------------------- conclusion -------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------

Again, almost all the code game logic I wrote it myself. ChatGPT is used for drafting and eventually the more I work on the code refining in the most recent good draft I end up overriding everything that ChatGPT has given me.
